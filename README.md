# Twine Minigame 3

In my game, I used variables like $key and $shrink to keep track of what the  player has done. Doing this, the game knows if the player has found the key or shrunk enough to fit through the door. I also used if and else macros to change what the player sees in a single passage. For example, the door passage checks if you have the key and are shrunk before letting you go through. If not, it shows a different message. I used an if/else here instead of making a new passage because the door itself does not change and only the options and text do.
